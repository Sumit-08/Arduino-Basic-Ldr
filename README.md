Learn how to do a basic ldr sensing with ardiono
please find the attached document
one is just the ruturn of the voltade value through analog pin to the serial monitor.
another one is the switching on and off a LED attachek with a current limiting resistor .. which is further controlled bu the returned value of the LDR
